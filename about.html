        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>As a recent graduate from Texas Christian University with a degree in General Communications.I bring a strong foundation in effective communication, problem-solving, and client service to my pursuit of web development.

My goal is to create online experiences that reflect the needs of real people, especially those whose voices are often overlooked. This journey is personal to me, and I’m ready to keep learning, building, and making a difference through thoughtful design and development.</p>
