<h2>CRAP Analysis</h2>

<h2>Contrast</h2>

<p>Amazon effectively uses contrast to separate the different types of content. For example: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Product titles are bold and dark aganist a white background, drawing attention and enhancing readability.</li>
    <li>Call to Action buttons like <b>"Add to Cart"</b> or <b>"Buy Now"</b> which are typically yellow or orange, standing out from the surrounding elements. </li>
</ul>

<p>However, Amazon does have some sections during promotions or events like Prime Day can become visually cluttered with many bright colors competing for attention, which may hinder quick navigation.</p>

<h2>Repetition</h2>

<p>The website maintains consistent layout patterns, button shapes, fonts, and color schemes throughout the site. This repetition helps users learn the interface quickly. </p>

<ul>
    <li>The navigation bar at the top stays the same across the pages, with repeated categories like <b>"Today's Deals," "Customer Service,"</b> and <b>"Returns & Orders."</b></li>
</ul>

<p> Repeating the product layout style like image, title, rating, price also supports easy comparsion and quick decisions for consumers.</p>

<h2>Alignment</h2>

<p>Amazon's alignment is mostly grid-based and structured, especially in product listings and navigation menus.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Text is generally left-aligned, making it easy to read.</li>
    <li> Filters on the left of the page and product results on the right that creates a clear layout for browsing.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, with Amazon having promtional banners or personalized ads this can slightly be misaligned or asymmetrcial, which may disrupt the user's reading flow and clarity.</p>

<h2>Proximity</h2>

<p>Amazon generally groups items logically like prices, product images, and rates are close together, making it easy to scan and digest information.</p>

<p>They also have filtering tools that are clustered in the left-hand panel, which helps users with navigation on the website.</p>

<p>However, the homepage modules can be stacked too tightly like deals, recommended products. This can create a "visual overload" effect that may overhelm new users trying to locate specific content.</p>
